## Stimuli 
	
**Stimuli** is a toolkit designed to help people who experience anxiety attacks regularly to be mindful when they start to feel anxious. When anxiety threatens our peace of mind, it can be difficult to stay in the moment.  This method, which relies on sensory awareness, has the potential to pull our brains free from the anxiety by grounding us in the present. For this we focus on our five senses â€” sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste.  

 

The toolbox contains several items which are used to stimulate the five senses. These can be used individually or all together -- this is completely up to you. Whenever you feel anxious or feel a panic attack coming up, you choose one of the stimuli for each of your senses, open the Stimuli app and follow one of the guided breathing exercises. This way all senses are stimulated simultaneously, to help you slow down your thoughts. 

 

Discover which of the stimuli work best for you and put these in your travelkit to have with you at all times.
