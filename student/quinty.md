## Lasting Dreams

We all dream, even if we don’t remember it the next day. Dreams are basically images that our mind creates while we sleep. They can be vivid. They can make you feel happy, sad or scared.  

Most of us also have a bad dream or even a nightmare, occasionally.  

But.. what if a (past) experience that resulted in trauma causes you to have these nightmares every night?  

There is something called nightmare disorder, also named; ‘parasomnia’. This disorder occurs when a person has frequent nightmares that interfere with their sleep, mood, and/or day/time functioning. 

### Lasting Dreams 

Lasting Dreams is a sleeping headband with a build-in EEG technology that is widely used by neuroscience researchers around the world. Machine-learning-based analyses can decode the brain activity patterns that visualize your dreams.  

The headband has a Bluetooth service that connects with an app specially made for the use of this device. In this app, there will be a file map available where only you and your therapist have access to. 

The visualizations are going to be used in the next therapy session, to help you understand and process your nightmares, so it can be decreased over time. 

### Go get some rest, you deserve it.
