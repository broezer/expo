### A shower that tickles all your senses.  

Let the digital screens, scent sensations and realistic sounds take you to another dimension after a long day. Relax in an tropical forrest with singing birds in the trees, medidate at a sunset on the beach or bathe under a tropical waterfall. While your relaxing the digital screens infused with vitamin D and light therapy* will make sure that when you are finished, you will have the feeling as if you washed all the stress away, energized to start another day or fully zen and ready for a good night rest. 

 
*Light therapy is a way to treat seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and certain other conditions by exposure to artificial light. SAD is a type of depression that occurs at a certain time each year, usually in the fall or winter.* 

*During light therapy, you sit or work near a device called a light therapy box. The box gives off bright light that mimics natural outdoor light.* 

*Light therapy is thought to affect brain chemicals linked to mood and sleep, easing SAD symptoms. Using a light therapy box may also help with other types of depression, sleep disorders and other conditions. Light therapy is also known as bright light therapy or phototherapy.*
