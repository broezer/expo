SENSE stimulates children to get the most out of their senses in a playful way. It is an interactive exhibit where in children from 8-10 years old learn to be self-aware, confident and empathic towards others. They learn this by doing activities in 5 different areas, learning all about their senses. Each area has the main focus on 1 of the 5 senses but also shows the interaction between the different senses.  

The areas are sight, touch, hear, smell and taste.  

SENSE will help the generation go through puberty without lots of insecurities and social struggles. Their confidence level will grow and therefore they will know better how to act on difficult situations, which ultimately results into a more open and safer society.  

To create a long-lasting memory of the achievements of SENSE there is a gift shop where the child can get different kinds of games, toys and cuddles to take home and keep as a memory.  

‘Before’ and ‘after’ the experience itself social media plays a big role. To reach the biggest possible audience social media accounts like Instagram and Tiktok will be used to advertise and show the experience. ‘After’ these same accounts will be a reminder for the child to what he/she has experiences in these same rooms.
