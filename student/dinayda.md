## Safechronic

Diabetes  is  a  disability  that  affects  mostly  people  living  in  low-  and  middle-income countries.  Approximately  465  million  adults  of  20-49  years  are  living  with diabetes,  by 2045  this  will  rise  to  700  million.  1  in  6  live  births  are  affected  by  diabetes  during pregnancy.   And   it   is   the   cause   of   4.2   million   deaths.   Safechronic   is   the   perfect intermediair solution for type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  

Safechronic  helps  diabetic  people  avoid  unexpected  symptoms  by  ensuring  the  control and monitoring of your balance system and the required medicines. Safechronic consists of three parts, two which are tangible; the bracelet and the capsules.  

The bracelet measures your blood pressure automatically for for up to 30 days. The only thing  you  have  to  do  is  wear  it.  It  has  different  capsules  that  are  required  for  you, personally. For type 1 diabetes, most of the capsules can be filled with insuline, that way the  user  doesnâ€™t  have  to  use  needles  anymore.  For  type  2  diabetes;  you  can  combine different  capsules,  which  all  have  different  functions.  Examples:  Diuretics,  Beta-blokkers, ACE inhibitors and Calcium channel blokkers. The other intangible part is the app, which illustrates aspects like; when the capsules are being used, how much of the capsules are being used and at when it is time to refill.  

### Be in control and be safe with safechronic.
