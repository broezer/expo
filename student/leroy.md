## H(2)O SAVE

H(2)O Save is a platform where users gain awareness of the current environmental state and get stimulated to change their current lifestyle into a more sustainable one.  

Thanks to scannable sticker which can be founded on products in retail stores, the scan will link you to a page within the application to provide information about its origin, the (social) impact and environmental-friendly alternatives to use instead.  

Within the application, you will find tons of information of sustainability in general. When creating an account, you can personalise your account with the help of question, which will give a personal feeling. The application will then generate valuable context, personalised to your input.
