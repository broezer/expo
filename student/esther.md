Nature has some amazing qualities to offer us. Plants and trees clean the air we breathe, they provide habitat for biodiversity to flourish and hold together the soil on our planet. Nature also makes us feel better. Did you know that hospital patients recover faster with a window view to nature? Or that test  results score higher when made in a room with plants? Or the  amazing discovery that trees and plants can generate electricity? 

To most people these great qualities come as a surprise. Yet, especially urban areas are in need of more greenery. City  residents suffer much more from depressions, stress and anxiety  than rural residents. We might have forgotten a bit how natures is taking such good car of us. The Glowing Gardens is a unique  experience that brings an innovative story without words. As    you walk through this urban park, enchanting flickering lights  surround you like fireflies. While harvesting their energy from the surrounding plants  and  trees,  the  lights synchronise with your heartbeat. Within three to four minutes after viewing  nature scenes, blood pressure, respiration rate, brain activity, and the production of stress hormones all decrease and mood  improves. As the magical lights guide you, they visualise these wonderful qualities nature gives us. Inspiring for more.
