## Multiwork

Multiwork is a platform where people living in high-risk areas can work together to upgrade their environment. Our climate is changing and we need to become resilient on this matter. Droughts, floods, or other extreme weather events are on the horizon. Instead of doing nothing, we as a community can make an impact. By sharing ideas on the bulletin board of Multiwork you can make an impact in your environment. Increase social cohesion by coming together and learn from each other.
