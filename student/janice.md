## The box - more than the pill  

A system, a test, an online toolbox, that helps women decide which pill suits them mentally and physically and while making that choice they get educated. When there is more care in the process of getting the right pill, and more care in providing the right education there will be less unfortunate outcomes. Women will experience lesser side effects, or at least they will understand them and know how to interact with them. Maybe more importantly women can get the right contraceptive without having to play guinea pigs for themselves. By giving better education women can make sense out of all of this and stay in control of their wellbeing and their body.
